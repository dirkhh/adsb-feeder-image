<p>This will create an anonymized log that removes IP addresses, locations, and any aggregator keys and other secrets
  from your logs and upload them to a website for easier sharing with the developers.</p>
<p class="{% if url != '' %}d-none{% endif %}">After you click the button, this will display a link that you can share
  on one of the support forums (and that you can review first to make sure no personal data is included).</p>
<p class="{% if url == '' %}d-none{% endif %}">The link to the uploaded log is: <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a>.</p>
<p class="{% if url == '' %}d-none{% endif %}">Please share this link with the developers who are trying to help you
  (and who most likely asked you to provide this info in the first place).</p>
<p>Please note, we offer multiple ways to upload these because the services tend to not reliably work from every
  location and at all times. So if you get an error, please try one of the other options.
