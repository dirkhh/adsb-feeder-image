Contributions of code and ideas are always welcome.
In addition, you can assist with testing the project and providing feedback on any bugs or issues that may arise.

By contributing to ADSB.im, you can help make this hobby more accessible to a wider audience, and encourage more people to get involved in the world of ADS-B tracking.

For simple changes, simply submit a PR. For more complex changes, please first create an issue where you outline your ideas and discuss the direction with the maintainer(s).

The main branch is where releases happen and it should always move in a 'fast-forward' style. The dev branch is mostly for testing things with the GitHub Actions pipeline and will see the occasional force-push.

Pull requests should usually be opened against the `beta` branch as I try to test things before they go into `main` and only move main forward as a `fast-forward` merge of `beta`.
